Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artmeis Financial is a consulting company seeking to improve and modernize its security features of its application. Integrating secure coding standards were a top priority. 

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I was thorough in how I conducted the vulnerability assessment and I prioritized any security issues. Encryption using sha-256 and checksum verification were implemented and fully functional. Coding securely protects data from breaches and hackers,, as well as complies with industry standards.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Identifying the vulnerabilities was quite a challenge, as this was a new practice to learn. I had to supplement my readings with some github research and youtube videos in order to fully grasp the concept. In the future, I will utilize penetration testing, scanning tools and make regular checks on my security.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I implemented sha-256 which is an extremely secure cipher that is nearly impossible to break, and it avoids collisions for the most part. I would utilize a risk assessment and talk amongst my peers to formulate a plan for any security needs.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I generated multiple dependency reports throughout my code refactoring to make sure I did not introduce new mvulnerabilities into my code. The dependency report was helpful in showing me the number of vulnerabilities. I also utilized the OWASP website for helpful information.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I utilized all module resources as well as github to help me with assignments. Insight from experienced developers on github was incredibly helpful.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I can show my willingness to go above and beyond for security needs as well as my ability to evolve as a developer.
